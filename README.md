# CyberbullyingDetection-WebApp
A web application that prints real time cyberbullying statistics based on a search query. The search query maybe a keyword or a geographic location.
The app enables the user to obtain real-time cyberbullying statistics by:
i) Retrieving a large number of tweets (1000 by default, this number is customizable) and classifying them as 'offensive' or 'not offensive'. The percentage of offensive tweets, the username of the offenders and the username of the victims are recorded
ii) Retrieving tweets pertaining to trending topics in a given area of location selected by the user and classifying them as 'offensive' or 'not offensive'. The percentage of offensive tweets, the username of the offenders and the username of the victims are recorded

The tweets classified as 'bullying' can be viewed by the moderator. Based on the moderator's second opinion, warning messages can be sent to the aggressors and support messages can be sent to the victims.
